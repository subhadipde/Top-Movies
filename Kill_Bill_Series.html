				<td>Beatrix Kiddo a.k.a The Bride is a female assassin, a trained killer who has been betrayed by The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad led by her former boss Bill who gunned her down at her wedding leaving her for dead. The Bride awakes four years later and she sets out to begin her quest for vengeance. With help of one of Bill's former tutors, retired sword maker Hattori Hanzo, The Bride sets out to eliminate her first two targets on her list: Vernita Green, who has retired from the Deadly Viper Assassin Squad and has a daughter and O-Ren Ishii, who is now the kingpin of the Toyko criminal underworld and leader of the "Crazy 88" crime gang. The Bride, engaging in a roaring rampage of revenge, will not rest until every member of The Deadly Viper Assassin Squad is dead and she will save Bill for last.</td>

				<td>After having successfully crossed the first two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad - Vernita Green, O-Ren Ishii, and the Crazy 88s, The Bride (whose real name is now revealed to be Beatrix Kiddo) sets her sites on the remaining three. While she goes after Bill's brother Budd, Elle Driver, and ultimately Bill himself, we learn more about Beatrix's back story. This includes her time in China training under ultra strict traditionalist martial arts legend Pai Mei, who had a taste for brutal action, and a super-secret technique that can take out any opponent, and how she got to be where she is. Unfortunately Elle and Budd are out to stop her from getting to Bill and learning the truth about the attack on her wedding four years earlier. Getting to Bill will be an ultimately rewarding experience for Beatrix, but can she get through Budd and Elle first?</td>
